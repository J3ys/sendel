            <li>Obtain and maintain your own API key from the AI service provider</li>

            <li>Be responsible for all costs associated with AI API usage</li>
            <li>Understand that your data will be processed by the third-party AI service according to their privacy policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. License and Access</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 License Grant</h3>
