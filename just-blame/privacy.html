                    Privacy Policy for Just Blame
                    Last Updated Date: 16.07.2025

                    Just Blame (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your information is handled securely and transparently. This Privacy Policy (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) explains how we collect, use, and protect information in connection with our Atlassian Marketplace app (‚Äúthe App‚Äù), which integrates with Jira and Confluence.

                    This Policy applies to our software-as-a-service application available through the Atlassian Marketplace (the ‚ÄúService‚Äù) and any associated website, if applicable (the ‚ÄúSite‚Äù). It also outlines your privacy rights and choices.

                    1. Information You Provide
                    When Using the App:
                    When you install and use the Just Blame App within your Jira and Confluence environment, we may collect minimal configuration data necessary to operate the App (e.g., Atlassian OAuth tokens or app settings). We do not collect, store, or access any of your Jira or Confluence content. All data is processed in real-time only, based on your actions, and immediately discarded after use.

                    AI Configuration:
                    The App allows you to connect to the AI provider of your choice (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini). You may supply API keys or configuration details to enable this. These credentials are stored locally on your infrastructure‚Äîwe do not collect, transmit, or store them.

                    2. Information We Collect Automatically
                    App Usage (Non-Identifiable):
                    We may collect aggregated and anonymized technical data (such as feature usage or error logs) to help us monitor performance and improve reliability. This does not include content from your Jira/Confluence workspace or identifiable personal information.

                    No Persistent Content Storage:
                    We do not store or retain any Jira or Confluence tickets, issues, comments, documents, or AI-generated content.

                    3. How We Use Your Information
                    We use the limited information we collect solely to:

                    Provide and support the App‚Äôs functionality

                    Facilitate the connection to your configured AI provider

                    Process and display insights from Jira/Confluence in real time

                    Improve the quality and performance of the App (using aggregated usage metrics)

                    We do not use any data to train, fine-tune, or improve any general-purpose AI or machine learning models.

                    4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
                    Just Blame does not sell your information or use it for advertising. We only share minimal information under the following circumstances:

                    Third-Party Service Providers: We may share operational metadata (e.g., Atlassian licensing details) with third parties that help us provide the App, under strict confidentiality.

                    Legal Requirements: If required by applicable law, regulation, or legal process, we may disclose information.

                    Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, any relevant non-sensitive information (such as license records) may be transferred to the acquiring party.

                    5. Data Security
                    We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data. All API communication is encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS/TLS protocols.

                    Because the App processes data in-memory and never stores it, the risk of exposure through our systems is significantly minimized.

                    6. Data Retention
                    We retain only essential, non-personal operational data (e.g., license status, anonymized usage stats) for as long as necessary to operate the App or fulfill legal obligations.

                    Jira/Confluence data and AI responses are never retained or stored by Just Blame.

                    7. Your Rights and Choices
                    Configuration Control: You control which AI provider you connect to and whether data is sent to it.

                    No Stored Personal Data: Since we do not retain any personal or content data, there is no user profile or stored record to access or delete.

                    Contact Us: If you have concerns or questions, feel free to reach out via the contact information below.

                    8. Children‚Äôs Privacy
                    Our App is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected data from a child, we will take steps to delete it promptly.

                    9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
                    We may update this Policy occasionally to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. All updates will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.
