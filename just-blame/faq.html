                    <h3>General Questions</h3>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What does Just Blame do?</h4>
                        <p>Just Blame adds inline author attribution to Confluence pages or Jira Issue. It shows you who wrote each section of a page without having to click through version history. Like "git blame" for developers, but for your Confluence wiki and issues.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How does Just Blame work?</h4>
                        <p>Just Blame analyzes history and displays color-coded sections showing who created each paragraph, table, heading, or section. Each author gets a unique color, making it easy to see contributions at a glance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Do I need to configure anything?</h4>
                        <p>No. Just Blame works immediately after installation. There's no setup, no API keys, and no configuration required. Just install and start using it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Does it work with existing pages?</h4>
                        <p>Yes! Just Blame works with all your existing Confluence pages. It uses the built-in page history, so it can show authorship for pages created before you installed the app.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What does "block" vs "inline" view mean?</h4>
                        <p>Block view shows the version history sidebar with a list of all contributors and timestamps. Inline view displays the authorship information directly within the content flow. You can toggle between both views.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
