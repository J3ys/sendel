                            <h4>What does Just Search do?</h4>
                            <p>Just Search is an Atlassian Marketplace app that performs Jira and Confluence search using your selected AI model. It enables you to search, summarize, and generate insights from your Jira issues and Confluence content using natural language queries.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which AI models can I use with Just Search?</h4>
                            <p>You can connect to various AI providers of your choice, including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude, and others. You have full control over which AI model processes your data by selecting your preferred provider in the app settings.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Does Just Search store my Jira or Confluence data?</h4>
                            <p>No. Just Search does not store any of your Jira or Confluence data. All processing happens in real-time, and data is immediately discarded after use. The app operates with a strict no-data-retention policy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How does Just Search protect my data privacy?</h4>
                            <p>Just Search gives you full control of your data by allowing you to select which AI model processes it. Your API credentials are stored locally on your infrastructureâ€”we never access or store them. No data is used to train any AI models.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What do I need to set up to use Just Search?</h4>
                            <p>To use Just Search, you need to provide your own API key for your chosen AI provider in the app settings page. You'll also need to configure the number of Jira issues and Confluence pages to be analyzed when answering queries.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I control how much content is analyzed?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. In the app settings, you can specify the maximum number of Jira issues and Confluence pages to be analyzed when processing your queries. This allows you to balance between comprehensive results and processing speed.</p>

                            <p>No. Your data is not used to train any AI models. Just Search processes your content in real-time using your selected AI provider, and no data is retained or used for training purposes.</p>

                            <h4>I'm getting API key errors</h4>
                            <p>Verify that you've entered a valid API key for your selected AI provider in the app settings. Make sure your API key has not expired and has sufficient credits/quota remaining.</p>

                            <p>Check your settings for the number of Jira issues and Confluence pages to analyze. If set too low, you might not get comprehensive results. Try increasing these values for more thorough analysis.</p>

                            <h4>The app is responding slowly</h4>
                            <p>Response time depends on several factors: the amount of content being analyzed, the complexity of your query, and the response time of your selected AI provider. Try reducing the number of pages/issues to analyze or optimizing your queries.</p>
