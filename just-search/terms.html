    Terms of Service – Just Search
Effective Date: 16.07.2025

Welcome to Just Search (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Thank you for installing and using our app via the Atlassian Marketplace (the “Service”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our AI-powered assistant designed to enhance productivity in Jira and Confluence.

1. Acceptance of Terms
These Terms set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern your use of the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent). You represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms. If you are under 18 years old or do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

2. Description of Service
Just Search is an Atlassian Marketplace app that enables users to search, summarize, and generate insights from Jira issues and Confluence content using natural language and AI.

Key features:

Secure integration with Jira and Confluence via Atlassian APIs.

Ability to connect to your chosen AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.) using your own API key.

Real-time processing of content without storing or persisting your Jira/Confluence data or AI responses.

The Service runs client-side or in-memory and is designed with a strict no-data-retention policy.

3. Account Registration
Some features may require administrative installation or configuration within your Atlassian workspace. You agree to provide accurate and complete information as part of any configuration. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your API keys and Atlassian credentials and for any actions taken using your credentials.

4. Data Privacy
We are committed to privacy by design.

By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that:

We do not store, transmit, or retain your Jira or Confluence content.

You are responsible for managing your own API keys and data connections to third-party AI services.

We do not use your data for training, analytics, or model improvement.

For more details, please review our [Privacy Policy].

5. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:

Use the Service in any unlawful or unauthorized manner.

Upload or transmit any content that is illegal, defamatory, abusive, or infringes on third-party rights.

Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or interfere with its integrity or performance.

Reverse engineer, resell, or commercially exploit the Service in violation of these Terms.

6. Refund Policy
If you're not satisfied with the Service, you may request a refund within 14 days of your initial purchase. Refunds are issued at our sole discretion and must comply with Atlassian's refund policies. To request a refund, contact us at [contact@justsearch.ai].

7. Intellectual Property Rights
The Service, including its code, design, and functionality (excluding content retrieved from Jira/Confluence), is owned by Just Search and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the Service.

8. Modifications to Service
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service or any part of it at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of major changes. We are not liable for any modifications or downtime.

9. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, error-free operation, or fitness for a particular purpose. Use the Service at your own risk.

10. Confidentiality
We do not access or store your proprietary content. Any technical or usage-related information shared with us (e.g., in support requests) will be kept confidential and used solely for providing support.

Confidential Information does not include information that is:

Publicly known at the time of disclosure.

Lawfully obtained without restriction from a third party.

Developed independently without reference to confidential materials.

We may disclose confidential information only if required by law, and where permitted, we will provide prior notice.

11. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law:

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of your use of the Service.

Our total liability to you will not exceed fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50), regardless of the nature or number of claims.

You agree that any claims must be brought within one year of the cause of action arising.

12. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in California.

13. Dispute Resolution
Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Service will be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California. The prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable legal fees.

14. Entire Agreement
These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, represent the entire agreement between you and Just Search regarding the Service and supersede all prior understandings or agreements.
